# WhatsApp Message Scheduler

## Overview
The **WhatsApp Message Scheduler** is a one-page application designed to schedule WhatsApp messages with ease. The application features a simple form that allows users to:

- Enter the recipient's phone number.
- Type the message to be sent.
- Specify the time the message should be sent (in 24-hour format).

Messages are scheduled to repeat every 24 hours, making it ideal for recurring reminders or notifications.

## Features
- **Simple Form**: A clean and intuitive interface to input the required details.
- **24-Hour Interval Messaging**: Messages are sent daily at the specified time.
- **Ease of Use**: Designed for personal use to simplify scheduling WhatsApp messages without needing complex tools.

## Motivation
I created this application because I needed a simple solution to schedule WhatsApp texts. Existing tools were either too complicated or lacked the specific functionality I required, such as daily recurring messages at a fixed time. This app fills that gap, offering a straightforward and reliable way to manage scheduled WhatsApp messages.

## How It Works
1. **Input Details**: Fill in the form with the recipient's phone number, message content, and the time (24-hour format) for the message.
2. **Schedule Message**: The app stores the details and ensures the message is sent at the specified time.
3. **Daily Repetition**: The message will automatically repeat every 24 hours until canceled.

## Requirements
- A WhatsApp Business API or compatible integration to send messages.
- An internet connection for the application to function.

## Future Enhancements
- **Date Selection**: Allow users to choose specific dates in addition to time.
- **Message History**: Display a log of sent messages.
- **Custom Intervals**: Support for scheduling messages at intervals other than 24 hours.
